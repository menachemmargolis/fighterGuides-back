His love for justice and determination to help those less fortunate is reflected in all aspects of his life. On the other hand, this also means he can show rather extreme dislike for anything that disrupts the peace or breaks the rules. After taking his position as King, this enthusiasm shifted into a broader perspective, allowing him to see the world from a variety of viewpoints. This isn't to say, however, that he can't still come off as na√Øve and emotional at times.", detail_image:"https://www.fightersgeneration.com/nf8/char5/ggstrive/ky-guiltygear-strive-artwork.png"},

He only speaks when required, and uses as few words as he can get away with. He's not very good at explaining things, so he prefers to express himself with his aggressive behavior and attitude.

Because there are only a handful of Japanese in this time period, they are under government protection. Thus, they do not receive the same treatment as regular citizens. Within the Japanese community, there are those that accept this treatment, and those that reject it. Anji is part of the latter; rather than being concerned about the preservation of his race, he wants to regain his freedom as a human being. Because of this, he disguises his nationality and travels the world in pursuit of 'the man' known to have created the Gears and who is responsible for the destruction of the Japanese people. However, he pursues him not out of hatred or revenge.", detail_image: "https://www.fightersgeneration.com/news2021/char/anji-mito-guiltygear-strive-character-art.png"},

May was able to reunite with Johnny after the tournament, which filled her with happiness. One day, as Johnny's birthday was nearing, the crew decided to give him a present as a sign of their appreciation. Compelled by her growing feelings for him, she wanted to give him a gift personally, not as part of the crew. The problem was, she didn't have money.

He is actually from the twentieth century. Born in the slums, he placed himself in the middle of gang warfare to bring peace to the town, and with his extraordinary physical prowess he was able to achieve his goal, without any casualties, in six months time. Some time later, he was forced to travel 150 years in the future. Hoping to gain passage back to his time, he entered the tournament. Instead, he was sent to another time period for a year's time. During that period, he was bounced around in the time-space continuum for an equivalent of three years. Through his journey, he learned that in each time period, there were always rumors of another time traveler like him. Axl believed that by pursuing the traveler known as 'the man', he could come upon a way to go back to his time. Sensing the presence of 'the man' behind the incident with the Gear, he decides to check it out himself. Axl's design is loosely based on Axl Rose of Gun's & Roses." , detail_image: "https://www.fightersgeneration.com/nf8/char5/ggstrive/axl-guiltygear-strive-artwork.png"},

Eventually, his drug dependency worsened to the point where he could no longer perform his job. No longer needed by the Mafia, Chipp was to be disposed of when a ninja, who later became his teacher, rescued him. Chipp began to open up to the man who saved his life, and became his apprentice. But, that peace was short-lived. Eventually, the Mafia killed the ninja. Trembling in anger, he vowed to take revenge on the Mafia. Unable to reach the final rounds in the tournament, he learned that his heart, skills and strength were still lacking, and devoted himself even more to his training. Upon seeing Justice's death, he realized that even the monster that massacred countless people was searching for help. This made him think about what a true helping hand was. It was then that he heard of a Gear that was not a threat to mankind.", detail_image: "https://www.fightersgeneration.com/nf8/char5/ggstrive/chipp-guiltygear-strive-artwork.png"},

He wears a white mechanical mask which resembles a Japanese hannya mask and fights with two katana. The name Nagoriyuki is Japanese for 'lingering snow,'' a sentimental phrase referring to out of season snowfall during the spring. Nagoriyuki's name is likely an homage to the famous 1975 folk song 'Nagori Yuki' by IRUKA, originally performed by the band Kaguya Hime in 1974.", detail_image: "https://www.fightersgeneration.com/news2020/char/nagoriyuki-guiltygear-strive-artwork-transparent.png"},

He shared a friendly rivalry with Ky Kiske, whom he was once good friends with during the Crusade Era. His battle capabilities and leadership are said to be so outstanding that, one time, while facing the dangers of being annihilated in the battlefront, he managed to lead his unit back to safety. Due to his disorderly way of speaking, he might seem like an open-hearted man, but he's actually rather conservative. He has a high self-esteem and hates losing, and he's also a hard worker who always gives it his all." , detail_image: "https://www.fightersgeneration.com/news2020/char/leo-whitefang-ggstrive-art-transparent.png"},

Originally a lowly assassin, he gained new power through a forbidden ritual, which allowed him to rise to his present position. The repeated battles of the last tournament took their toll on him, and the shadow seized control of his body. The shadow was cognizant that it was created as a weapon and that its intentions of murder and destruction were only programmed instincts. It had developed the will of its own; the ability to break away from its cursed fate. This newborn soul could not understand humans, and was filled with loneliness. While in search for others like it, the shadow comes across the rumor of the Gear. He is named after the blind swordsman Zatoichi, which is how Zato-1 would be said in Japanese." , detail_image: "https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chara_pc_zat.webp"},

Having taken the rest of the slave soldiers hostage, he was sentenced by his superior to enter the tournament. During the tournament, he learned that a coup d'etat was in progress. In the end, the coup d'etat succeeded and Zepp was freed from its dictatorship. President Gabriel, Potemkin's former instructor, summoned him for a secret mission; to protect a Gear from the bounty hunters and bring it back safely to Zepp. Though Potemkin is unable to discern the mission's true motive, he decides to trust his former master, and accepts the mission." , detail_image: "https://www.fightersgeneration.com/nf8/char5/ggstrive/potemkin-guiltygear-strive-artwork.png"},

I-No will poke her face into anything or anywhere she has interest in. During the time of Guilty Gear XX, I-No manipulates many characters against one other, and hands out fake bounty lists to Jam and Bridget.

Her conscience would not allow her to murder innocent people, and as the result, she left the organization. Being pursued by the assassins, she decided that it was more efficient to put an end to the organization than to run away from it. She entered the tournament to kill Zato, the leader of the organization. Her plan was technically a success and she did gain her freedom, but her feelings - the guilt of causing her former master to be overtaken by the shadow and the fear of having to confront him again - still troubled her. Finally, out of her agony came a conclusion: I must finish him off." , detail_image: "https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chara_pc_mll.webp"}
