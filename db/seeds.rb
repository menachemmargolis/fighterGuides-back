# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:

#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

His love for justice and determination to help those less fortunate is reflected in all aspects of his life. On the other hand, this also means he can show rather extreme dislike for anything that disrupts the peace or breaks the rules. After taking his position as King, this enthusiasm shifted into a broader perspective, allowing him to see the world from a variety of viewpoints. This isn't to say, however, that he can't still come off as naÃ¯ve and emotional at times.", detail_image:""},

While most see him as selfish and violent, those closest to him accept him for who he is.", detail_image:"test detail" },
